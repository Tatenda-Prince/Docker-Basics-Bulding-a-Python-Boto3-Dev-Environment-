# Intro

Imagine building your dream house. You start by laying the foundation, then adding walls, wiring, plumbing, and all the other essential components. Once everything is complete, you have the house of your dreams, ready to live in and enjoy.

Now, suppose you decide to move this house to a different location. This would be a challenging and costly endeavor because you’d need to dismantle the entire structure, transport all the pieces, and then painstakingly reassemble them at the new site. Wouldn't it be so much easier if you could simply pick up the entire house and relocate it in one seamless move?


This is where Docker comes in. Docker is like a special container that you can put your house into. Instead of taking the house apart and moving all the pieces, you can just pick up the container and move it to the new location. Everything that’s inside the container, including the foundation, walls, wiring, plumbing and everything else, stays together and works just the same as it did before.

In software development terms, Docker is a platform that allows developers to package up their applications and all the necessary components, like libraries and dependencies, into a single container. This makes it easy to move the application from one environment to another, like from a developer’s laptop to a testing server or from a testing server to a production server.

Just like how a house can be put into a container for easy moving, software applications can be packaged into Docker containers for easy deployment and portability across different computing environments.


Today, I’m going to take you through some of Docker’s fundamental commands and concepts by creating a Python/Boto3 development environment involving building a custom image, running containers and creating bind mounts to repos.
